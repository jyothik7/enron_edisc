Mr. Harris:

Crescendo Energy, L.L.C. (“Crescendo”) is sending this letter to restate Crescendo’s position to Wildhorse Energy Partners, LLC (“Wildhorse”) that in accordance with that certain Gathering, Processing, and Transportation Agreement between Wildhorse and Crescendo dated October 19, 1993, (the “Gathering Agreement”), Crescendo has the right to deliver all of its gas to any mainline carrier off of Wildhorse’s system.  
Wildhorse has again refused to honor Crescendo’s nomination for redelivery of all of Crescendo’s gas to NWPL for the month of December 2000.  Since Wildhorse has again unilaterally, falsely, and wrongfully decreed that Questar is the only pipeline interconnect that Crescendo may use as a redelivery point, Crescendo has nominated some or all of its December production for sale through that point.  Crescendo has done so solely to mitigate the damages caused by Wildhorse’s breach of contract, and with full reservation of rights to hold Wildhorse responsible for all revenues lost and other damages proximately caused by Wildhorse’s breach of contract.



     Sincerely, 
     Crescendo Energy, L.L.C.

      its Managing Member



      Ken Krisa
